# HPR Rocket Avionics
Code for data acquisition electronics on a Tripoli Level 1 High Power Rocket (HPR)

As of 4/2/2024, this is the first iteration. Currently just collects data and ~~stores on SD card~~ displays to ground station serial monitor.
Uses nRF24L01+ 2.4GHz modules for radio communication.

Second iteration will be an upgrade to 900MHz with RYLR998 and data logging. Possibly even control loops for fin actuation.
